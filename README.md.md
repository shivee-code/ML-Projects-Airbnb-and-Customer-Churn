# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects – Airbnb Price Prediction & Customer Churn

This repository includes two end-to-end machine learning projects developed as part of an educational assignment.

---

## 📊 Part 1: Airbnb Price Prediction

- Built a regression model to predict Airbnb listing prices using features like location, amenities, and host attributes.
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling using scikit-learn and XGBoost.
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R², and extracted actionable insights for pricing strategy.
